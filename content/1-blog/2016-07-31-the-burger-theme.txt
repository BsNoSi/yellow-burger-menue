## Good to know

- You may or may not add a "Sidebar:" header note. Because preset in config.ini it will be used — if available.
   - If there is no sidebar available, the template doubles the basic navigation. I did not fix that, because I had no idea, why. And it is simple to avoid it: add an empty sidebar.
- I do not know, how example behaves in multi language area.
- Theme setup is based on Yellow V 0.6.5

> You can use this "as is". I can not guarantee that I can give support. Hints and error messages are welcome.
